These two will create a dataset for GPT2 based on Alex's specifications

The first notebook uses a mounted gdrive, but there may not be enough space in google drive for both the FFNN files and the GPT2 data CSV

If so you can use the 2nd notebook which downloads the FFNN files from my drive, and you can upload it to yours. Warning, this notebook is untested.
